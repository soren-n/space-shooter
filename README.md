2d space shooter prototype for Android.

The packaged android app can be downloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5011285/rockit.apk).
Install the app over USB through the commandline:
```
adb -d install -r rockit.apk
```
Make sure you have developer options enabled as well as USB debugging.

Otherwise you can build and run the game on desktop (requires macOS or linux):
```
./desktop.sh
```
